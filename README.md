# PC-ASSEMBLE

🗓️ Date : 12 November 2025 (Wednesday).

⏰ Time : 10.00 AM - 12.00 PM

🏫 Location : Software Innovation Lab, N28

 Summary of What I Gained: 
- I learned the step-by-step process of assembling a computer, including installing the motherboard, CPU, RAM, storage devices, and power supply.
- I gained hands-on experience in handling delicate components safely, such as securing cables properly.
- I understood the importance of compatibility between hardware parts, like ensuring the CPU matches the motherboard socket type.
- I improved my teamwork and communication skills by collaborating with peers during the assembly.


During the PC assemble activity, I gained valuable hands-on experience in putting together the different components of a computer, such as the motherboard, CPU, RAM, storage devices, and power supply. This process helped me understand the importance of compatibility between hardware parts and taught me how to handle delicate components with care, including managing cables properly. I also improved my teamwork and communication abilities by collaborating with others. However, I believe the activity could be improved by providing checklists to avoid missing small but important tasks, allocating more time for troubleshooting and testing, and including sessions on BIOS setup and software installation to make the learning process more complete. Beyond the technical skills, this activity gave me confidence that I could build my own PC in the future, sparked my interest in exploring performance upgrades, and made me realise that assembling a PC requires patience, precision, and creativity. Overall, the experience was not only educational but also inspiring, as it encouraged me to think about how hardware and system optimisation can be applied in real-world scenarios.
